# Problems

- The spider is specific to AstraZeneca's new website, it cannot yet adapt to updates
- There is no feature to notify or 'update' that the website has changed
- The spider must be told where to look for the addresses

# Types of 'changes' that can occur

- Domain name changes
- Content of the website changes (text)
- structure of the website changes (DOM)

# Ways to monitor changes

- Check XML sitemap
